/// its I/O to the screen).
/// The driver is capable of MIDI in and out by mean of two MIDIQueue buffers, and can process incoming and
/// outcoming messages with optional MIDIProcessor (for transposing, muting, etc.). It inherits from pure
/// virtual MIDITick, i.e. a class with a callback method TimeTick() to be called at every timer tick. You can
/// also set a function for further processing.
/// This class is used by the MIDIManager together with a MIDISequencer for playback; AdvancedSequencer uses
/// it too. See the example files.
