/// A high level, all-in-one object capable to load an play MIDI files.
/// Its features include:
/// - Loading of MIDI files with a single call to a class method
/// - Play, Repeat Play (i.e. loop) and Stop commands
/// - Allows jumping from one time to another (even during playback) with correct responding
/// to wheel, patch, controls and sysex changes
/// - Individual solo, mute, velocity scale, transpose and rechannelize for every track
/// - Global tempo scale
/// - MIDI thru: you can play along with your MIDI instrument while the sequencer is playing
///
/// This class embeds many jdksmidi objects: a MIDISequencer (with its MIDIMultiTrack) for
/// storing MIDI data, a MIDIDriver to communicate with hardware MIDI ports, a MIDIManager for
/// handling sequencer playing, some MIDIProcessor for transposing, rechannelizing, etc.
/// At current time, the class can manage MIDI playback only on WIN32; for other OS it prints to
/// the console a dump of sent messages.
